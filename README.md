Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
Software engineering is a discipline that focuses on designing, creating, testing and maintantaning computer softwares.
It is very important in technology in this sence;
_Easens complexity_ .
_Enhances effectiveness_
_Cost friendly_


**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
1. _The early era_ which involved the development of High-level languages like Fortan and COBOL which facilitated himan-readable codes. this is where softaware engineering became a real thing.
2. _Object Oriented Programming (OPP)_. This is the era that saw to the rise of languages like Java and C++ which provided an opening for reusable code designs.
3. _The Agile era_ which is the phase that saw to better developments in terms of Scrum and Kanban which are more flexible.


**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
the phases of software development are the planning, designing, implementing, testing, actualizing and maintaning.
1. _planning_ basically involves first identifying a problem that needs to be solved, analysing that problem and contemplating on the possible solutions. It might also include putting in place a team and necessary resources to work on the same.
2. _designing_. This is where a structure or prototype of the solution is put in place. It provides a skeleton of how the final project is supposed to look like.
3. _implementing_ is giving like to the skeleton (design). This is the phase where the project is built.
4. _testing_ phase is where the implemented project is run to see how well it meets its desired functionality. It is done to segments of the project and also the project in full. Ommissions, adjustments and additions are done here in the attempt to make the project as viable as possible.
5. _actualizing_ is bringing the project into reality and actually decomissioning it and making it fully operational to the end user.
6. _maintaning_ is ensuring that the project continues to operate efficiently. It can involve trouble-shooting and problem solving on the project when need arises.


**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**


**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
**

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each**.


**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**


**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models**.
Prompt engineering refers to generating and availing instructions that guide AI to give a desired output. It majorly involves the trial and error approach. 
It is important in interacting with AI models as it;
_1. allows control over AI output_. Prompt engineering shifts control dominance of the output from the machine to the user. This is very important since AI is supposed to serve human users and hence need to have focused outputs.
_2. improves accuracy and relevance_. the approach helps 
_3. enhances neutrality_. Prompt engieering helps reduce biased outputs and instead maintain them as neutral as possible
_4. makes user experience better_ as it makes the o
_5. promotes flexibility and adaptability_



**
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
A vague prompt is when AI is given a rather general aspect to tacle. An example is to ask AI to ask AI to provide a recipe i.e _"give me a recipe for a nice meal"_. It is better to ask put it as _"give me a recipe for pork ribs, suggesting relevant ingredients and their measurements"_. The second prompt is way better as it is clear and specific to the recipe needed. It is more effective as it reduces the ambiguity of the prompt and helps the AI to give a response that is most relevant to what is needed.
